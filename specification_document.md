The purpose of this project is to create a neural network with a backpropagation algorithm for image classification with Python. Specifically the neural network is trained to classify
handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. The backpropagation algorithm will make use of directed acyclic graphs to track the gradients and a topological sorting algorithm to 
sort the directed acyclic graphs for backpropagation. The program will receive the handwritten digits as input along with the hyperparameters of the neural network that should be trained.
