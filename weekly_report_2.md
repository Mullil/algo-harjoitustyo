# Weekly report 2

This week I started to implement the tensor class, which is used for all
of the computations to store the values and track gradients. I wrote unit
tests for the class to see that the basic operations and gradient calculations
work properly. I also started to sketch the neural network, but it is not
ready to be committed yet. Thus, I would say that the program has
progressed well, but there is still much to do.

This week I did not learn much, as the programming was mostly just applying the
math and ideas I learned last week. However, I studied activation functions and
loss functions that would suite the image classification task, so I learned how to adapt
a neural network for this task.

This week there was nothing too challenging or particularly unclear. The only thing that is
somewhat unclear about the project is the testing of the neural network, so I will need to
do some more planning on it.

Next I will write the loss function and its gradient function for the tensors,
and try to finish an initial implementation of the neural network. After this
the backpropagation algorithm should be ready to be implemented for training.

This week I used around 6 hours for the project.
